    <h1>RECIPE FOR MAKING PASTA</h1>
    <img src="images/pasta.webp" alt="">
    <p><strong>Pasta is a type of food made from a mixture of flour, eggs, and water that is formed into different
            shapes
            and then boiled. Spaghetti, macaroni, and noodles are types of pasta. </strong></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>You’ll need just five ingredients to make this easy homemade pasta recipe:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This homemade pasta recipe starts with two cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs lend fat and moisture to the pasta dough. </li>
        <li>Oil: Two tablespoons of olive oil add moisture and help the dough come together. </li>
        <li>Salt: A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Water: Add just enough water to form a smooth, thick dough. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make homemade delicious pasta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough. </li>
        <li>Turn the dough out and knead it for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let the dough rest. </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into balls.</li>
        <li>Use a pasta machine to roll and cut the dough into desired shapes. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil, add the uncooked pasta, and stir. Cook until the
            pasta is al dente (until it has a slight bite)</li>
        <li>Fresh pasta takes less time to cook than dried pasta, so keep a close eye on it — it should take between two
            and five minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve this homemade pasta with your favorite sauce!</li>
    </ol>
